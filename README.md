# Videogame Programming - P1
First project of the videogame programming subject, in which we have made a small 2D game using C++.

## Basic description
The aim of the game is to survive the enemies that appear until we reach the final boss and destroy it. To do this we can move and we can shoot at the enemies, which are moving towards us.
